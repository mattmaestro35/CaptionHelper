# CaptionHelper

Program to help add captions to images in a visually appealing way.

Specifically, it will blur the bottom sixth of your input image, add that onto the original picture, and then place your caption in the new blurred region. This will allow you to add captions without ugly white boxes as backgrounds. 

To use, add the image you want to modify to the src/main/resources folder and follow the instructions when the program is run. The modified image will be created as a copy, leaving the original untouched.
